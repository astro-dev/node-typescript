`Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
CPR is an emergency procedure performed to restore the breathing and heartbeat when either or both have ceased. By authorizing CPR, I agree to pay a minimum fee of $400 in addition to other fees previously authorized,
regardless of my petâ€™s survival.

I understand that after exercising reasonable medical judgment and determining there appears to be no hope for medical success, CPR efforts will cease. I understand that I will be contacted as soon as possible if an arrest occurs. I also understand that despite the best efforts of the doctors and staff my pet may not regain his/her normal mental and physical health.`,
